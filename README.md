### Benefits

#### Create Child theme easily

If you have ever managed and customized a theme, creating a child theme is probably not unfamiliar. 

Child theme is understood as an inherited copy of all properties of the parent theme (original theme you want to edit). 

It’s very useful when you want to customize the parent theme as required.
- *Why should use child theme*

Customizing directly on the original theme will be very dangerous. 

When you update to the latest Magento version or update the theme, customizations will be lost due to the overwrite of the new version files.

Using Child Theme will help you freely customize CSS and code without fear of losing because you only need to update the parent theme, and the child theme remains the same.

- *Customize from Magento admin panel*

Magepow Manage Theme provides a website featuring professional child theme creation from the admin panel.

No need to use commands, modules make it easy to manage theme in the store with just a few basic steps:
